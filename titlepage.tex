\noindent{}We would like to acknowledge Patrick Jones for his permission to include his videos on our site. We would also like to thank all the wiki contributors throughout the years for their hard work in writing and reviewing templates and mathematical content, in particular, our founder David Kohler (who is also the inspiration for our mascotâ€™s name, David Webster). We are also grateful for the UBC Math graduate committee for subsidizing pizza and sushi at some of our work sessions.
